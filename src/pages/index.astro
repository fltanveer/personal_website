      I tried several times to create case studies and failed üò¢. Tried to find
      out what I was lacking and got depressed üòû over time. I tried again to
      follow Dribble and Bahnace for inspirations. I got more frustated.
      Somewhere I felt like people are faking so much to survive or grab the
      attention for recruiters üòê. It is actually a problem since I found out my
      way of Micro case studies. My Goal is simple. Write whatever challenges I
      took and what did not work out for me. I hope you will enjoy the read üöÄ.
