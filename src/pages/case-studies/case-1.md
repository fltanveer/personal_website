>It is a UI designer’s nightmare to have to demonstrate to stakeholders who have less knowledge. Colors and layout are usually hard to argue with. The more difficult it is for a UI designer to stand out if he/she lacks the solid knowledge of defending their choices.This is story of designing a homepage for a top tier club

### App Overview

Unet is a banking app Provided by united commercial Bank. The sole purpose of the app is app is to avoid the branch queue and use the power of convenience to manage banking needs from the comfort of home. User can also perform some day to day task like Mobile recharge o/ MFS platform transfer like Bkash-Nagad / Pay utility bills.

### Why think of Redesign?

As I have account on United Commercial Bank and I am a day to day user of the Unet App I felt discomfort using this app. At first I thought may be I’m having the problem since this is the first banking app I was exploring back then but I noticed some of my collegues were having the same problem. Everyone remain silent because the app was serving the purpose and adpoted the app already.

### Why think of Redesign?

Conducting Interview was easy for me. I just took schedule from 5 of my co-workers who were already existing users for the app. Two of them were female and 3 were male.

Got some interesting Insights while doing the Interview. See below for the detaild Interview session-

I asked to use photograph but as this is going public my female co-worker requested not to use her picture. So I’m placing a dummy instead.

So they liked the idea and confirmed this layout. There were some other struggles I’ve been through but I don’t want to make this read a lengthy one. If you want to see the live website. The link is [here](https://www.gulshanclub.com/)</a>
