>It is a UI designer’s nightmare to have to demonstrate to stakeholders who have less knowledge. Colors and layout are usually hard to argue with. The more difficult it is for a UI designer to stand out if he/she lacks the solid knowledge of defending their choices.This is story of designing a homepage for a top tier club

### App Overview

Unet is a banking app Provided by united commercial Bank. The sole purpose of the app is app is to avoid the branch queue and use the power of convenience to manage banking needs from the comfort of home. User can also perform some day to day task like Mobile recharge o/ MFS platform transfer like Bkash-Nagad / Pay utility bills.

### Why think of Redesign?

As I have account on United Commercial Bank and I am a day to day user of the Unet App I felt discomfort using this app. At first I thought may be I’m having the problem since this is the first banking app I was exploring back then but I noticed some of my collegues were having the same problem. Everyone remain silent because the app was serving the purpose and adpoted the app already.

### Why think of Redesign?

Conducting Interview was easy for me. I just took schedule from 5 of my co-workers who were already existing users for the app. Two of them were female and 3 were male.

Got some interesting Insights while doing the Interview. See below for the detaild Interview session-

I asked to use photograph but as this is going public my female co-worker requested not to use her picture. So I’m placing a dummy instead.

#### From user interview and Empathy map now the problems came out bold. Here are some listed problems that I found out. Added some problems as well from my perspective

### Problem Statement

- When the app launch it shows the Action menu insted of login.
- Checking balance is easy but for multiple accounts it is so tiny dropdown.
- The app is confusing and sometimes user feels overwhelmed.
- Beneficiary management is not good. For repeating transfers to same account the benificiary management is not giving a very pleasent experience.
- Mobile recharge and MFS Transfers are frequent need. It takes a good amount of time to perform these tasks.
- Transaction History is hard to find and It is decentralized even after they are connected with the same account.
- Old UI elements make users laggy while they perform task.


#### Some old screens for better understanding -

### User journey Map
From the problem statement I tried to create a user journey which is far from complete but I had an overall idea-

#### The problem statement is ready with the journey map but there is still something I needed to take care. While exploring the problem I found out some spieces that can really boost the the business as well. I mean this is not the best app in the market but some important changes on the app can count this at least as a competior. So visualize the problem and tried to align the needs and Business value in the same ground.

### Pen paper sketches

As this is a banking app most of the screens contains form elements which is necessary for banking, transfer purpose. Changing those screens and making the fields rearrange may result to hamper the soul purpose of a banking app. I decided to only focus on dashboard as users will be redirected to any kind of banking affairs with this screen. 

>NB: For banking app some banks provide username to respective email address some don’t. For security purpose Unique user Id from bank makes the app more secure in many ways.
