### Understand the problem

Understanding the problem is one of the key abilities of a designer. As a designer, you not only create astonishing visuals but also make an impact on your intended audience. Making a solution before finding out the exact problem can lead to a bigger problem that can be discovered in the long run. Therefore, never hesitate to call attention to a problem that is a result of another problem. Speak up!

### Revise the requirements and analyze as you own them!

Until you talk back with valuable tones, you are a puppet. Don’t just start work after you get a full requirement. Revisit it multiple times. Are there any awkward parts? Do things seem too perfect? Well, be the one to validate before start working. Understand the vision from the plain texts. Discuss the features, upcoming features, and if necessary, analyze the competition.

### Wireframing Pen paper or tool?

Like most people, I’m not a big fan of pen and paper. Don’t just hate me. For me, paper can sometimes be a loss of information. Our lives are so digitally connected that most of us are more comfortable writing on the keyboard than on paper. A pen and paper is the best way to proofread a wireframe. I use low-effort wireframing tools to create wireframes, and then I draw flowers, circles, etc., in a printed copy. I find this method very effective. This is just my opinion. I am not looking to start a war.

### Visual Design

The cream is here! Everyone loves this part. When you have to create a perfect visual design for a specific group of users that must satisfy stakeholders, that can be a nightmare! Start slowly. Build a mood board. Compile information. Take inspiration from proven design systems. If necessary, copy them and you will find your very own design system. Be careful how you interpret “copy”. It will not make you a criminal. It will help you understand how the system works. What they did to make this amazing system work. Don’t just follow the rules blindly. Break them and modify as your need. Make your own. You’ll be able to do it when you’re knowledgeable enough. Hope is always present.

>And don’t forget the basics like Typography, Higherechy, Hick’s Law and Gestalt.
