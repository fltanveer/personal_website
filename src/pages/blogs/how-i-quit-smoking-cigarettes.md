## 

>I started smoking 14 years back. The reason was nothing but gaining experience. If you ask how was the taste? I must say I can't express. I pushed myself several time to smoke till the Nicotine takes me all over. I could not find the exit point for last one year so I created my own way.

## Why I needed to quit?
Smoking is bad for health? No, this is not the only reason. There are plenty of them. I found some of them in my day to day life.

- Expensive (As I smoked the best brand's cigarrete my country produced)
- Had an Issue with spitting too much to get rid of bitter taste.
- After 1st 4-5 puffs the taste got bad and most of the time I ended consuming the rest for the sake of money I spent!
- Bad breath.
- I felt my brain dried without this several times.
- The craving is real and sometimes unbearable.
- I am a father now. So, I need to be more responsible.

>I found it very difficult in the beginning when I decided to quit. So many failed attempts and I tried again.

## Attempt 1
From 8-12 cigarretes daily I reduced the number down to 5/6 and started drinking a lot water. So what goes wrong and what goes right?

- Water was helping me and with a stomach full of water smoking was difficult.
- Had fatigue and dry mouth and ended up taking one to get rid of the situation.
- At night my craving got unreal and started to smoke more.

## Attempt 2
I stopped bringing my own cigarretes to workplace and started to borrow from other people. Then I realized I am actually making myself cheap and got embrassed over time. Soon I get back to daily routine and buying my own. Well this could be the end point if I need to be honest!

## Attempt 3
I stopped smoking on smoking zone that my workspace provide. As soon as I got the craving for cigarrete I ran down to shop, purchase and puff. What a relief!

But this turned out to be time consuming and soon I get back to the loop <b>Attempt 2</b>

>After so many failed attempts I tried a new way. But the way was not healthy at all. I am being very truthful here.

## So what did I do?

I did not try to quit smoking! Just switched the brand and with lesser nicotine and Tar. The brand was suggested by a friend. Soon I realized some key factors-

- The numbers did not reduced but increased as the Cigarrete was smaller in size.
- The expense got cut down to half.
- Reduced bitter taste and Tiredness.

#### After 3 months, I tried to go for Attempt 1 and surprisngly that showed a better result. Since I was taking less Nictotine and tar my body was used to with this and the craving was lot lesser than before. What a Joke!

## I started to feel that I can do this! <br> Attempt 4 it is

One very good day I went to Vape Shop and asked them to Suggest me a Juice that will have the least amount of Nictine. Thats it.

#### I did not buy a single cigarrete since then.

some remarkable changes I found in between the transition - 
- No more Fatigue
- No more Bad breath
- No more unnecessary spitting
- No More Unbrearable craving
- BullsEye

But there are some downside as well.
- No cigarrete? More Vaping
- Extra layer on teeth and tongue (I don't know what should I call it.)
- Sometimes tongue feels numb and no taste.
- Sweeten mouth for few minutes.

So far I found these. And I will quit this one as well.

## Did I take the right decision?
Vape is never a good choice for better health but it gives a fake satisfaction to mind. Right now I'm using this satisfaction to encourage my next attempt to quit vaping. Next week I'm taking a Nictineless Juice and after that I only need to take control of my Mind. Thats it.

> This is not a promotion for vaping and I'm not supporting Vaping instead of smoking cigarretes. Both are bad for health. I just wanted to share my  feelings and my way of taking every detail seriously. No Smoking, Please.
